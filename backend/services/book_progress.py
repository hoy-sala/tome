"""The sticky-completion progress→status rule, shared by every write path.

Used by the device position sync, the device session flush (TomeSync), and the
manual "Log session" endpoint. Before this helper each site carried its own
diverging copy — the tome_sync copies had an ``if/elif`` quirk where an unread
book synced straight to 100% became "reading" instead of "read" until the next
sync.

Rules:
- Completion is sticky: a "read" book is never un-finished by a later write
  (re-reads don't drag it back); only the resume CFI keeps tracking.
- ``pct >= 0.99`` finishes the book: status "read", progress pinned to 1.0,
  ``finished_at`` stamped (once) — even coming straight from "unread".
- Otherwise any positive progress moves an "unread" book to "reading".
- ``monotonic=True`` (session flush, manual log) only ever advances
  ``progress_pct``; ``monotonic=False`` (device position sync) tracks the
  reported position last-write-wins, downward included.
